# Zinium

 Well, here you go. What more can I say?
 
### Installation

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run. I just threw that in because it sounds real fancy.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd zinium
$ npm install
```
You can run it normally like any HTML page.
